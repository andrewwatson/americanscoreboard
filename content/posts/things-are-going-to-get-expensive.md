I'm starting to see a lot of things like this in various media lately: "What's going to be more expensive?" and it's
refreshing to an effort to get ahead of what could happen if Trump follows through on his insane threats to impose 25%
tariffs on everything imported from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China.

[CNN - What could get more expensive if Trump launches a new trade war with Mexico and Canada](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/business/tariffs-mexico-canada-more-expensive/index.html)

[NYT - Trumpâ€™s Tariff Threat Pits Canada Against Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/mexico-canada-trump-tariffs.html?camp=7JFJX)

Keep an eye on this. It's going to get worse before it gets better.
