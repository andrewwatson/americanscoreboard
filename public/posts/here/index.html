  <p>The Second Inauguration is upon us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know just what kind of onslaught is in store for us in the coming weeks and months. There will be a tidal wave of hate, fear and grift.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a non-stop stream of lies about anything and everything. We saw this before in 2017 but it&rsquo;s going to be worse this time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve learned from the first iteration that there are people of character that will get in their way. This time around, they&rsquo;re prepared to get rid of them.</p>
<p>There are no longer norms to be protected. There are no longer standards and morals. We can&rsquo;t pretend to be shocked and surprised when this administration flatly disobeys court orders, our laws, our constitution or international treaties.</p>
<p>They will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. We should stop at nothing to thwart them.</p>
