  <p>I&rsquo;m starting to see a lot of things like this in various media lately: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to be more expensive?&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s
refreshing to an effort to get ahead of what could happen if Trump follows through on his insane threats to impose 25%
tariffs on everything imported from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China.</p>
