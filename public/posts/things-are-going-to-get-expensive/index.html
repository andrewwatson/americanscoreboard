  <p>I&rsquo;m starting to see a lot of things like this in various media lately: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to be more expensive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the primary goals of this site is to get ahead of what could happen if Trump follows through on his insane threats to impose 25%
tariffs on everything imported from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China and to make it plainly evident the source of these price increased and economic slowdowns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/business/tariffs-mexico-canada-more-expensive/index.html">CNN - What could get more expensive if Trump launches a new trade war with Mexico and Canada</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/mexico-canada-trump-tariffs.html?camp=7JFJX">NYT - Trump’s Tariff Threat Pits Canada Against Mexico</a></p>
<p>Keep an eye on this. It&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better.</p>
