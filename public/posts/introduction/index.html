This idea came from a post by Josh Marshall at TalkingPointsMemo where he asked about possibly keeping track of some key metrics throught this second Trump administration.
It would be very beneficial for Democrats to create scorecards right now charting where inflation, unemployment and GDP were at the end of Biden’s term and regularly updating it with Trump’s latest numbers.
My intention is to build just that sort of thing on this website but it&rsquo;s just getting started and I&rsquo;ll probably need help!">
